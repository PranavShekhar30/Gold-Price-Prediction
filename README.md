# Gold Price Prediction
Using Random Forest Regressor model (Machine Learning using Python)


•	Developed a Random Forest Regressor model to predict the price of gold using techniques of Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering and Feature Selection       using Pandas Profiling, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy.
•	The model was found to predict the results to the accuracy of 98.8%.
•	Used the concepts of Correlation matrix and Heatmaps.
